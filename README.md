# Surround for Atom

Surrounding selections with characters since 2014. This concept is entirely stolen from tpope's Surround and isn't even a shadow of its functionality yet.

**Warning:** This is not an officially published package yet and is under heavy development, it is not recommended that you become too dependent upon it yet.

## Usage

Enter *surround-mode* with `cmd+option+s` and select `[ { ( < ' "` to surrond the selection with the respective characters. When there is no selection, the surround set will simply be inserted at the cursor position.
